That‚Äôs why we partner exclusively with organizations working to make a positive impact in the world‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs saving lives, protecting the planet, educating future leaders, or supporting underserved communities. We‚Äôre looking for an Account Executive who thrives on meaningful connection, understands digital strategy, and is motivated by closing deals and opening doors to doing more good in the world. Why work at Yoko Co? Do good, better: We exclusively serve clients who make a positive impact on the world. This is your chance to build things that help create a better place for all of us. 4-day work week and lots of holidays. Mondays are flex days, meaning you‚Äôre free to take them off if you‚Äôre caught up on your work. Plus, we‚Äôre closed for nearly a full week at Thanksgiving (November), and two weeks at the end of the year, plus a bunch of other days, too. Work-life balance FTW! High performance, no jerks. You‚Äôll collaborate with good people who believe in doing great work. Best Place to Work (and that‚Äôs not just our opinion). We‚Äôve been named a Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and Washington Business Journal. About the Role: As an Account Executive at Yoko Co, you‚Äôll lead the charge in connecting mission-driven organizations with digital solutions that amplify their impact. From prospecting to proposals, you‚Äôll own the sales cycle‚Äîand play a key role in growing our reach and deepening our purpose. What You‚Äôll Do: Build authentic, lasting relationships with mission-driven organizations through proactive outreach, networking, and follow-ups. Own the full sales cycle: identify opportunities, lead discovery calls, deliver tailored presentations, and close contracts. Serve as the front line of screening and alignment to ensure prospective clients are a fit for our culture, capabilities, and cause. Collaborate with marketing and leadership to optimize our go-to-market strategies. Maintain up to date records in our CRM to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability across the sales pipeline. Contribute to internal knowledge sharing and continuously improve the sales process. Occasionally help support other team member sales conversations or initiatives and paperwork for new and existing clients. You‚Äôll Succeed in This Role If You: Have at least 3+ years of experience selling digital services (websites, digital strategy, marketing, or related)‚Äîideally within an agency. Have significant experience with WordPress. Are energized by people and love discovering what makes them (and their missions) tick. Can guide strategic conversations and clearly explain complex digital solutions to both executives and technical stakeholders. Are naturally proactive‚Äîspotting opportunities, solving problems, and taking initiative is your default mode. Communicate clearly and empathetically‚Äîwhether by email, Zoom, or in a room full of execs. Are deeply organized, know your way around a CRM, and thrive when juggling multiple accounts and timelines. Bonus Points For: Experience selling in nonprofit, association, or purpose-driven industries. Familiarity with CRM platforms. Active participation in professional networks, councils, or mission-aligned communities. Culture Fit: This role is for someone who‚Äôs excited by the thrill of the chase and the meaning behind the mission. You‚Äôll need to be a self-starter, team player, and someone who‚Äôs not afraid to get a little scrappy when the moment calls for it. We don‚Äôt do egos here‚Äîwe do empathy, excellence, and impact. However, maybe don‚Äôt apply if: You prefer opportunities to come to you. Sure, some of that will happen, but as the saying goes, fortune helps those who help themselves.

You‚Äôre the kind of person who says, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my job‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs below my pay grade.‚Äù While we try to utilize everyone in the best way possible, sometimes it‚Äôs more important to roll up your sleeves and prove you‚Äôre a part of a team. You‚Äôd rather wait for someone to tell you what to do. The interview process: You‚Äôll do 3-4 interviews with various team members, starting with a short culture interview, and then moving on to more specialized conversations. Somewhere in the middle of the process, you‚Äôll likely do a short practical assessment to ensure you can deliver at the level it takes to be successful here. If you work here: You‚Äôll get a competitive salary, unlimited time off, a flexible schedule, the ability to work wherever you want, a personal development budget, federal holidays, and multiple weeks off at the end of the year to recharge. We also provide profit sharing to everyone on the team. If you‚Äôre in the US, we offer health insurance, disability and life insurance, and 401k matching. A little more about us: We‚Äôre a group of people who are passionate about the work we do, the clients we serve, and improving our craft.
