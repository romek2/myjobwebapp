Introduction Elite Software Automation (ESA) is a specialized consulting and technology firm focused on creating intricate business process, systems, and automations solutions to help its clients scale their businesses and run a more efficient operation. As part of these solutions, ESA develops custom business software systems for its clients. These systems are used to run a variety of business processes in the client's business, including various customer interaction processes, as well as many back office operations and internal organization within the business. These systems are intricately designed to cover very specific and unique details of our client's business processes, which are complex and full of detail. In addition to logical complexity, ESA also has a demand for speedy delivery of solutions to its clients to implement such solutions in the client's business in a matter of weeks or a few months, not years. Over the years, ESA has developed a very specialized home-grown methodology for making such solutions, and powers it with specialized experts in business process efficiency and business software fields, uniquely designed processes to design and build business software solutions, and a uniquely put together home-grown technical platforms stack to power these solution developments. The way ESA makes its business software solutions is very different to how other companies do it - this way involves very intense and particular ways of working (further described below in this job posting). The QA Engineer role in ESA is responsible for getting the software development completed to a functional quality standard. The QA process in ESA has specifically been designed to focus on closing software development releases in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Our QA process is distinct in that it minimizes the typical bug tracking bureaucracy, places a large amount of self-accountability on developers for self-testing their work before it gets to QA, and specifically makes QA engineers focus on their core responsibility which is to most efficiently complete releases and get them ready to operate in our clients' businesses.

To see the full job description, click \"Apply\" to be taken to our site where you can see a fully detailed description of how this position works in our organization, the expectations, and other details. We are looking for experienced QA Engineers to join our team and produce results for our clients. Our QA Engineer position is specifically focused on results and offers promotion opportunities to QA Engineers who demonstrate a successful record of closing production releases and making them work in our clients' business. This position is not for a bug reporter or a Jira issue creator, rather it is for a focused expert in delivering working software that meets business requirements and is ready to operate in a real business setting. The QA Engineer in Elite Software Automation is a high responsibility position requiring high skill, high effort, and high focus on achieving results. Successful QA Engineers are promoted with pay raises and greater responsibilities, while underperforming QA Engineers are not kept in the team.
